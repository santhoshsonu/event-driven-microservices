# event-driven-microservices

Event-driven microservices architecture with patterns using Spring boot, Spring cloud, Kafka and
Elasticsearch

The microservices pattern implemented are:

1. Externalized configuration with Spring Cloud Config
2. CQRS with Kafka and Elastic search
3. Api versioning for versioning of Rest APIs
4. Service Registration and Discovery with Spring Cloud and Netflix Eureka
5. Api Gateway with Spring Cloud Gateway
6. Circuit breaker with Spring Cloud Gateway and Resilience-4j
7. Rate limiting with Spring Cloud Gateway and Redis to use Redis as the Rate limiter
8. Distributed tracing with SLF4J MDC, Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin
9. Log aggregation with ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana)
10. Client side load balancing with Spring Cloud Load Balancer
11. Database per Service
12. Messaging between microservices using Kafka

Spring Security Oauth 2.0 and OpenID connect protocols for Authentication and Authorization using
Keycloak and JWT.
